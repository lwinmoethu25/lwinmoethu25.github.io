Hopefully, in the future we will be able to increase this,&#8221; Azhar said, adding the EC would decide on which voting stream to be used for the live telecast later.</p><p>Speaking at a press conference yesterday, he said the EC wanted to ensure transparency, while also educating the public on the electoral process.</p><p>Azhar said the vote counting would be broadcast on EC&#8217;s social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. </p><p>The Cameron Highlands by-&#173;election will be held on Saturday, Jan 26. There will be 14 days allocated for campaigning, with nomination set for Jan 12 while early voting will be held on Jan 22. </p><p>A total of 32,009 registered voters are eligible to vote in this by-election based on the electoral roll of the third quarter of 2018. </p><p>The Cameron Highlands by-election is estimated to cost RM3.5mil. </p><p>The Cameron Highlands District and Land Office will be used as the nomination centre while vote tallying will be held at Dewan Jubli Perak Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah. </p><p>The EC is also welcoming NGOs to become observers for this by-election. </p><p>&#8220;These bodies will be allowed access to the nomination centre, voting centres, vote-counting centres and the vote-tallying centre to do their observation,&#8221; said Azhar. </p><p>The by-election came about after the Election Court found that corrupt practices were committed during the 14th General Election, which led to the victory of Barisan Nasio&#173;nal&#8217;s Datuk C. Sivarraajh.</p><p>On Nov 30, the Election Court declared the win null and void. Sivarraajh did not appeal the decision, paving way for the by-election. </p><p>He won the seat in a five-&#173;cornered fight with a majority of 597 votes over his closest opponent, M. Manogaran of Pakatan Harapan. </p><p>The Cameron Highlands by-election is the fifth to be called post-GE14, after Sungai Kandis, Balakong, Seri Setia in Selangor, and the Port Dickson parliamentary by-election. </p><p>All four by-elections were successfully defended by Pakatan. </p><p>The Cameron Highlands seat is the first Barisan seat to be contested after GE14.</p><p>Meanwhile, the EC will seek legal advice on whether Sivarraajh is eligible to contest in the by-election. </p>"

They do this to create false identities, particularly to pursue deceptive online romances. </p><p>Catfish dating is dangerous for many involved and those who meet online are not what they appear. Sometimes they even lie about their gender. Catfish dating has resulted in many disappointments and dangerous situations for those attempting to date online.</p><p>When dating online, there are certain precautions that should be taken, including an insistence that communication is carried out via cell phone or using a chat website such as Skype so that both individuals can determine who they are actually talking to.</p><p>Those seeking to date online should also check their date&#8217;s identity through the use of a web search. Checking out the individual on sites such as Twitter or Facebook can help determine whether the individual&#8217;s identity is real or if they are faking it. People conceal their identities online for many reasons and one involves financial scams.</p><p>Such was the case that happened in Malaysia in 2016, where Malaysian women lost RM71mil to love scammers. These women topped the list of victims who lost a total of RM1bil in online scams.</p><p>So how can you tell if someone if dealing with fraud? Obviously, the general rule must be that if you meet anyone online, and for some reason they cannot meet in person and requests money, there is a very high probability that it is a fraud.</p><p>Many victims are reluctant to file a complaint. however, this may help prevent someone else from being defrauded because most fraudsters have many victims. Making a police report would help to deter this kind of crime in Malaysia. </p><p>So to all people out there, especially women, do not give a stranger your details even if when you meet a hot new romantic prospect online or in person.

I am rereading <i>An Autobiography: The Story Of My Experiment With Truth</i> by Mahatma Gandhi. After seeing the newspaper report, I continued with my book and coincidentally came upon the part about a co-worker of Gandhi&#8217;s who sounds remarkably like our own Puteri Parti Keadilan.</p><p>Writing on his trusted assistant Sonja Schlesin, Gandhi said: &#8220;Her sacrifice was great ... Her courage was equal to her sacrifice. She is one of the few women I have been privileged to come across, with a character as clear as crystal and courage that would shame a warrior ... </p><p>&#8220;She knew neither night nor day in toiling for the cause. She ventured out on errands in the darkness of the night by herself, and angrily scouted any suggestion of an escort. </p><p><i>&#8220;</i>I could go on without end writing thus about Miss Schlesin, but I shall conclude this chapter with citing Gokhale&#8217;s estimate of her. Gokhale knew every one of my co-workers. He was pleased with many of them ... He gave the first place to Miss Schlesin amongst all the Indian and European co-workers. &#8216;I have rarely met with the sacrifice, the purity and the fearlessness I have seen in Miss Schlesin,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Amongst your co-workers, she takes the first place in my estimation.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>The long and hard struggles for reformation in Malaysian politics hold out the promises of a new era for Malaysia Baru. May the flames of Reformasi burn on and on until Malaysia becomes a mature and developed nation in which there is a place for all Malaysians under the sun and where the government is corruption-free and rakyat-centric. </p><p>I urged all our Members of Parliament, State Assembly Representatives, civil servants, NGOs and interested citizens to read about the remarkable life story of Theodore Roosevelt in which he took part in different positions in American government and made great reforms whether he was in the New York state legislature that was renowned for its corruption, the police commissioner of New York City, being the assistant secretary of the Navy or for his dynamic leadership as the youngest US President. </p><p>His autobiography is a highly readable and enlightening elucidation of his varied experiences at reforms. </p><p>Our leaders should take Teddy Roosevelt as an exemplar. Roosevelt once mentioned that he would take a look at the portrait of one of his heroes, Abraham Lincoln, in the White House and wonder what Lincoln would have done in his position when faced with a difficult problem and used that as a guide for decision making. </p><p>We should always remind ourselves that we are mere mortals and realise that what profoundly makes our lives meaningful in the end is to have made some positive differences not just for ourselves but also to society and the world at large. I also like President Barrack Obama&#8217;s sage words: &#8220;Be useful, be kind, be fearless.&#8221; </p><!--PSTYLE=BT-8.5-Justified-Droid--><p/><!--PSTYLE=BT-8.5Intro-Justified-Droid--><p><b>TAN EE WAH</b></p><!--PSTYLE=BT-8.5-Justified-Droid--><p><b>Mentakab, Pahang</b></p>"

On Dec 15, I was on my way back from a friend&#8217;s birthday party. At about 1am, I was on the Kesas highway, driving at about 90km/h and wanting to get home to my frantic husband, but remaining calm and alert. </p><p>The highway was still unusually busy, and there were many motorists who were speeding and racing.</p><p>Two cars closely overtook me at high speed, and then my car was hit from behind by a speeding car driven by a young lady. She crashed into the left side, sending my car spinning into the leftmost lane. I assumed she was also trying to overtake me at high speed. We were lucky that both of us lived to tell the tale.</p><p>I struggled out of my car and went to a nearby petrol station to get help. There was a couple who were walking my way to board their vehicle, but much to my shock and disbelief, both the man and woman ran away from me as if they had seen a ghost! </p><p>I went to the station employee and he kindly helped me.</p><p>It is understandable that due to a prevalence of cheating and fraud cases, people have become wary of people who look like they are in trouble. </p><p>But surely the public should be able to tell a genuine incident from a bogus one and take precautionary measures to safeguard themselves when aiding others?</p><p>I believe media reporting too &#8232;can play a vital role in restoring people&#8217;s confidence in the act of kindness. More focus should be given to good samaritans and the encouragement of such deeds.</p><p>Education too will go a long way towards creating caring and ethical individuals &#8211; a key component of a civilised and progressive society. Hence, I strongly support the re-introduction of civic studies into the school curriculum.</p><p>Returning to my accident, I allowed my car to be towed away and repaired at a particular workshop after a tout convinced me it was reliable and responsible. </p><p>Much to my dismay, three days later, after the tout failed to take my car to the police station for photographing, I decided to go to the workshop to check on my &#8232;car. </p><p>When I told them that I was taking my car elsewhere for repair, they refused to release it. After a lengthy argument, they demanded a sum of RM1,500 for release. I was intimidated by touts shouting at the top of their voice and glaring angrily at me. </p><p>I called the police officer in charge of the investigation for help, but he casually replied that his part of the work was done and it was up to the touts and me to work it out.</p><p>Aren&#8217;t the police the keepers of safety and peace in this country? If one cannot rely on them to step in in situations that could potentially erupt into serious crimes, who can one turn to? </p><p>Not having a choice, I was forced to agree to the demands with five men snarling at me, a sole lady in a hijab. </p><p>No one should have to feel this sense of helplessness and victimisation. And so I strongly urge the government to create a new &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; for accident victims to ensure that the public and drivers who are in shock and trauma at the site of accident are not taken advantage of by touts. </p><p>Steps should be taken to make it an offence for touts to be at the scene of an accident. Instead, all vehicles should be towed into police custody and subsequently released to authorised workshops. </p><p>I also suggest that accident scenes be cordoned off and concealed from public view to avoid hours of traffic build-up. </p><!--PSTYLE=BT-8.5-Justified-Droid--><p/><p><b>JUMMANA SAIFUDDIN</b></p><p><b>Kota Kemuning, Selangor</b></p>"

But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.&#8221;</p><p>Parents have nothing to fear with the culling of these examinations as their children will still be assessed, except that this time, it will be in a more holistic manner.</p><p>A &#8220;report card&#8221; of sorts will be given, showing how strong or weak a pupil is in certain aspects.</p><p>It is time for society to change its mindset, time to let go of the concept that written examinations are the only way to assess pupils&#8217; performances.</p><p>There have been too many pupils with perfect examination results who can barely communicate or contribute to the workforce later.</p><p>Mother-of-two Sheila Chetty said the idea sounded &#8220;beautiful&#8221; but she hoped that the ministry would spell out the details for teachers to carry out the proposed changes. </p><p>&#8220;I fear without exams, parents will have no idea where their children stand. </p><p>&#8220;However, I am all for fun learning, class projects, experiments and outdoor learning &#8211; which can take place at the school compound. </p><p>&#8220;At year end, parents should also be given a report showing them their child&#8217;s project-based work,&#8221; she said.</p><p>Urging teachers to not take a step back with the new system, Sheila said there should be written exams along with the proposed projects.</p><p>Parent V. Yabitha expressed worry over whether pupils would be able to cope with the level of difficulty for subjects like Bahasa Melayu (BM) after Year Three.</p><p>&#8220;Some parents have said that BM becomes extremely hard in Year Four and above. </p><p>&#8220;So, what will be the level of difficulty as these kids will not have sat for exams in Years One to Three? Will they be able to cope when they are in Year Four?</p><p>&#8220;The children find that BM is hard in the current exam-oriented system,&#8221; said the mother of a Year Two pupil.</p><p>Suhana Koting said the abolishment of mid-year and final-year exams had its pros and cons.</p><p>The advantage, said Suhana, was that a class-based assessment would ensure the continuous assessment of pupils.</p><p>&#8220;However, I&#8217;m not sure whether it will be a burden for the parents, pupils and teachers, and whether we are ready for it as it will demand higher commitment from all. </p><p>&#8220;If we really want to change the assessment method, we have to examine and consider it comprehensively,&#8221; she added.</p><p>The ministry should do a thorough study before implementing any changes, she said, adding that consideration should be given to manpower and facilities too.</p><p>National Union of the Teaching Profession secretary-general Harry Tan said the union was on the same page as the ministry.</p><p>Tan said one of NUTP&#8217;s concerns, however, was that parents might feel teachers weren&#8217;t fulfilling their duties, by doing away with exams.</p><p>Tan said parents should meet teachers more than once a year (on report card day) to discuss the child&#8217;s progress.</p><p>&#8220;This way, you have direct access to teachers &#8211; and vice versa.</p><p>&#8220;Both parents and teachers will help each other to ensure the right education is delivered to the child,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Tan said the plan was to bring back fun learning to pupils and not stress them about getting As.</p><p>&#8220;Developing character and instilling values are important during their formative years.</p><p>&#8220;They should view this as a means of obtaining a holistic education.</p><p>&#8220;It will be a challenge to change society&#8217;s view and embrace this new change, but as an educationist, we feel it is important to start with this step for the future of our children,&#8221; said Tan.</p>"

It&#8217;s hard.</p><p>&#8220;Tiger made it look so easy over the years.</p><p>&#8220;Being No. 1 for 13 years is very impressive but to be able to be a dominant player, that&#8217;s the biggest thing.</p><p>&#8220;I wanted to be one of those guys.&#8221;</p><p>Winning takes care of everything.</p><p>Woods used to talk about that when he was getting back to No. 1 after a two-year absence.</p><p>Day won twice and dropped a spot in the ranking.</p><p>Part of that is a testament to the depth on the PGA Tour and how hard it is to win. </p><p>Bryson DeChambeau went from No. 99 to No. 5 on the strength of four wins.</p><p>Woods started at No. 656 and winds up at No. 13.</p><p>In those cases, they were low enough to make up ground in a hurry.</p><p>For players just outside the top 10, making up ground requires winning and having a steady diet of chances.</p><p>Day had only the two wins. He never reached the 18th hole with an opportunity to win at any other tournament.</p><p>What bothered him more was his performance in the Majors.</p><p>His best finish in the last two years was a tie for ninth in the 2017 PGA Championship.</p><p>&#8220;When you don&#8217;t play well in the Majors, when you don&#8217;t finish well in the FedEx Cup, that&#8217;s disappointing to me,&#8221; he said.</p><p>&#8220;I always gear myself around playing well in the Majors and the last couple of years have been pretty hard.&#8221;</p><p>He starts up again in two weeks at Kapalua for the Sentry Tournament of Champions, which he missed last year.</p><p>He wants to start well again and make up ground.</p><p>The big test will be contending in a Major for the first time since his runner-up finish in the 2016 PGA Championship at Baltusrol.</p><p>More than anything, he wants to see if he can dedicate himself to a big year on the course and at home.</p><p>&#8220;You have to learn balance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you want to get to No. 1 in the world, you have to be super selfish.</p><p>&#8220;When that happens, you&#8217;re sacrificing family, you&#8217;re sacrificing friends, you&#8217;re sacrificing everything else other than golf.&#8221;</p><p>He chuckled and said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing the divorce rate on No. 1 players in the world.&#8221;</p><p>Day has known only one way to play his best golf &#8211; with a relentless, methodical work ethic.</p><p>Now he wants to find his path with a wife and three kids along for the ride.</p><p>Even if that means giving up a few hours of sleep.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t sleep well, anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8212; AP</p>"

Yet whether it was a feeling of World Cup nostalgia, or the fact that players were still in their early energetic days of the season, the Nations League began with a series of pulsating and compelling ties.</p><p>Holland, who had not qualified for the World Cup, were resurgent under coach Ronald Koeman and heaped more misery on Joachim Loew&#8217;s Germany by beating them 3-0 at home in October.</p><p>Virgil Van Dijk&#8217;s stoppage-time equaliser in the return fixture last month then secured their progress to the final-four stage of the competition next year where they will play England.</p><p>Finals hosts Portugal will face Switzerland in the other tie.</p><p>Lower down the chain, Gibraltar secured their first ever competitive victory by winning 1-0 away to Armenia.</p><p>It was a similar story for Kosovo, who were relishing playing among teams of similar stature in League D, eventually topping Group 3 to gain promotion. &#8212; Reuters</p><p/>"

Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal &#8211; they are so close. </p><p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think about one opponent or we are the only one that can stop City.&#8221;</p><p>Liverpool face City at the Etihad on Jan 3 but, with three other fixtures first, that is not yet on Klopp&#8217;s mind.</p><p>Liverpool learned on Monday they will face Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League, with Klopp calling it a &#8220;big, big challenge&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;The good thing is a couple of years ago if we&#8217;d have had Bayern Munich it would be like, &#8216;Wow, no chance&#8217;. The thing is we have a chance. That is enough to know.</p><p>&#8220;We know it is difficult, they know it is difficult and that&#8217;s how it should be. Two big games, 100 per cent.&#8221;</p><p>Klopp also said that rightback Trent Alexander-Arnold is making progress in his recovery from the ankle injury sustained against Napoli last week, and is hopeful the 20-year-old could still play a part in Liverpool&#8217;s festive programme.</p><p>&#8220;It actually looks surprisingly good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think Wolves will still be a bit too early but after that, they told me we can think about him.</p><p>&#8220;So far he didn&#8217;t train but the pain goes down second by second, which is good. </p><p>&#8220;The moment when he can deal with it, he is on the pitch, and the moment he is on the pitch we&#8217;ll make a decision. But it looks good for Trent.&#8221; &#8212; AFP</p><p/>"

Toxic. Whiny. Defeatist. Words that have sprung to mind in Mourinho&#8217;s plummet to mediocrity this season also risked washing off onto the United brand. At a time when the club are facing more intense competition than ever &#8211; for fans, for revenue and for results on the field &#8211; from both established rivals and other teams fuelled by foreign money like Manchester City, United couldn&#8217;t wait around for Mourinho to get his mojo back.</p><p>Mourinho and United always seemed like an odd couple. Their union in 2016 was one of convenience, not a meeting of minds.</p><p>United wanted a big name. Serial trophy winner Mourinho was as big as they come.</p><p>For the coach who accumulated silverware in Portugal, Italy, Spain and in two spells at Chelsea, United offered a stage unmatched in size &#8211; they turned their greatest managers into legends, like Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson.</p><p>But United and Mourinho also made compromises that two-years later fed into their separation, announced in a terse, pro-forma, three-sentence statement from the team on Tuesday.</p><p>By hiring the tactical pragmatist who has always prioritised results over style and has zero qualms about winning ugly, United made their supposed love of attractive and attacking football ring hollow.</p><p>Mourinho-ball was accepted, but not revered, in the first two seasons at Old Trafford only because they delivered two trophies (Europa League, League Cup) and a face-saving runner-up spot in the Premier League behind cross-town rival City in 2018.</p><p>But the turgid gruel served up by Mourinho&#8217;s deflated team this season wasn&#8217;t worthy of the so-called &#8220;Theater of Dreams&#8221;, where the likes of George Best are still spoken of with wonder and where many remember the heady days not long ago when Ferguson built a legacy that Mourinho will now never come anywhere close to matching.</p><p>The compromise Mourinho made, which eventually proved fatal for him, was agreeing to work for a club that were never going to let him do everything his own way. </p><p>Perhaps the self-described &#8220;Special One&#8221; imagined that, with time, he&#8217;d eventually be able to compel United and their players to follow his every command and that, like Ferguson, he would be able to buy, sell and bench whom he liked.</p><p>But those days ended with Ferguson.</p><p>As Mourinho lost his power struggles with the United board, getting some but not all of the players he wanted, he cut an increasingly frustrated, lonely and unsympathetic figure. </p><p>Yes, he had players out injured and, yes, the United squad could, in an ideal world, always be strengthened with additional purchases. But it was hard to feel too sorry for Mourinho given the expensive stars he still had at his disposal. </p><p>As the weeks wore on in what has become the worst-ever start for United in the Premier League, it became ever clearer that Mourinho, not his players, was the biggest problem. They were no longer responding to his abrasive style and public criticism, and weren&#8217;t busting a gut for United as Ferguson&#8217;s teams did. </p><p>Midfielder Paul Pogba, a World Cup-winner this July for France, came to symbolise Mourinho&#8217;s squandering of expensive talent. He was stripped of the United captaincy and benched again in what proved to be Mourinho&#8217;s last match in charge, a 3-1 defeat to Liverpool.</p><p>Changing tack so dramatically midseason could backfire. It assumes that the players will pick themselves up and respond better to the temporary manager that United say will oversee the team until the end of the season while it hunts for a successor to Mourinho.</p><p>But leaving Mourinho in place, for United to go backward while City go from strength to strength under Pep Guardiola and Liverpool thrill with Juergen Klopp, could have been riskier still. </p><p>The hole was only getting deeper. The digger had to be stopped. &#8212; AP</p><p>&#8232;</p><p/>"

However, the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) will have the final say on what they want to do with the situation.</p><p>&#8220;I have not had talks with the FAM officials.</p><p>&#8220;Nothing has been arranged. It is still early and the situation is quite fresh.</p><p>&#8220;We just have to see what the FAM decide and which way it is going to go,&#8221; said the 30-year-old playmaker from Halifax, England.</p><p>Englishman Tuck is eligible to play for Malaysia under FIFA&#8217;s heritage ruling due to his maternal Malaysian grandmother.</p><p>On Wednesday, Terengganu coach Irfan Bakti claimed that FAM are looking into getting Tuck a Malaysian citizenship to play for the Harimau Malaya.</p><p>If Tuck gets the nod to play for Malaysia, he&#8217;ll be the seventh player under the FIFA heritage ruling to don the national jersey after Junior Eldstal, La&#8217;Vere Corbin-Ong, Matthew Davies, Darren Lok, Brendan Gan, Khair Jones, Kiko and Natxo Insa.</p><p>The former Bangkok FC player first came to Malaysia in 2017 when he joined Premier League side Negri Sembilan. At the time, his only intention was to do well for the club.</p><p>&#8220;I never thought of playing for the country at the time. I was only focused on doing well for the club, and the journey after that has been nothing short but amazing,&#8221; said Tuck.</p><p>When asked what he could add to the national team, Tuck said: &#8220;I hope to bring my physical presence to the field. I hope to bring my work rate going up and down the field for the national side.</p><p>&#8220;The aim is to make the national team stronger and be part of their success.&#8221;</p><p>Tuck played 30 games for Terengganu last season and scored 14 goals in all competitions. He is known for his stinging shots, pinpoint accuracy and ability to dictate tempo in the middle of the field.</p><p>He hopes to continue his excellent form in the 2019 season and wants to help the club win at least a trophy.</p><p>&#8220;I am expecting to do one step better and try to win at least a trophy. 2018 was fantastic for us, but no one expected us to do well,&#8221; added Tuck.</p><p>&#8220;Now, we have to work harder and improve on the form we had last year. We do not want a step back.</p><p>&#8220;It is time to step forward and win trophies.&#8221;</p>"

But an exodus of Umno elected representatives and party members after the May 9 general election has cast doubt on his leadership.</p><p>Party secretary-general Tan Sri Annuar Musa and information chief Datuk Shamsul Anuar Nasarah confirmed that Ahmad Zahid was still the president.</p><p>&#8220;He did not resign his position as party president.</p><p>&#8220;He is on leave, which means he no longer makes decisions or gets involved in the decision-making process of the party leadership,&#8221; said Asyraf Wajdi, adding Ahmad Zahid did not specify how long he would be on leave.</p><p>Barisan Nasional whip Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said Ahmad Zahid would remain as opposition leader in the Dewan Rakyat.</p><p>&#8220;No change at this point as it&#8217;s still too early to decide, with the Dewan Rakyat only meeting again in March next year.</p><p>&#8220;The position of opposition leader is also something that needs to be discussed with other opposition parties and not just among Barisan,&#8221; said Ismail Sabri, who is an Umno vice-president.</p><p>Among the opposition, Barisan presently has the most number &#8232;of seats at 39 with Umno holding 37, followed by one each by &#8232;MCA and MIC.</p><p>The other major opposition party in the Dewan Rakyat is PAS, which has 18 seats in the 222-seat House.</p><p>Ismail Sabri said Ahmad Zahid&#8217;s decision to step aside was unexpected.</p><p>&#8220;My take on this situation is that he knew it would be a hassle to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to vote against him.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why he made this sacrifice to step aside and let the deputy president run the show,&#8221; said Ismail Sabri.</p><p>Article 9.12 of the Umno constitution states that members of the supreme council, which includes the president, can be sacked with the support of two-thirds of delegates at an EGM.</p><p>Umno sources said calls for Ahmad Zahid to go grew louder following the spate of recent resignations from the party.</p><p>Six Umno MPs &#8211; Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin (Larut), Datuk Rosol Wahid (Hulu Terengganu), Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad (Mersing), Datuk Shabudin Yahaya (Tasik Gelugor), Datuk Mohamad Fasiah Mohd Fakeh (Sabak Bernam) and Datuk Seri Ikmal Hisham Abdul Aziz (Tanah Merah) &#8211; announced their resignation last Friday.</p><p>A few days earlier, Sabah Umno lost nine of its 10 assemblymen, five of its six MPs and 22 of its 25 division chiefs.</p><p>&#8220;We could no longer avoid talking about the issue. People were leaving Umno.</p><p>&#8220;Whether you like it or not, the president is one of the reasons why this is happening,&#8221; said a division chief.</p><p>It is understood that one of Umno&#8217;s three vice-presidents had sent a letter to Ahmad Zahid on Monday listing reasons why the president should resign.</p><p>Sources said that while the letter was not strongly-worded, the message that the leader wanted to convey to Ahmad Zahid was crystal clear.</p>"
